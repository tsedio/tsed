## Features

Currently, `@tsed/typeorm` allows you to:

- Configure one or more TypeORM connections via the `@Configuration` configuration. All databases will be initialized when the server starts during the server's `OnInit` phase.
- Use the Entity TypeORM as Model for Controllers, AJV Validation and Swagger.
- Declare a connection with asyncProvider or automatically by server configuration.

## Installation

To begin, install the TypeORM module for TS.ED:

```bash
npm install --save @tsed/typeorm
npm install --save typeorm
```

Then import `@tsed/typeorm` in your Server:

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-configuration.ts

::: warning
Don't forget to import the TypeORM module in the Server. Ts.ED need it to load correctly the TypeORM DI, entities and repositories!

## TypeORMService

TypeORMService lets you retrieve an instance of TypeORM Connection.

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-usage.ts

For more information about TypeORM, look its documentation [here](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm);

## Declare your connection as provider

It is also possible to create your connection with the `useAsyncFactory` feature (See [custom providers](/docs/custom-provider.md))
This approach allows you to inject your connection as a Service to another one.

To create a new connection, declare your custom provider as follows:

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-async-provider.ts

Then inject your connection to another service or provide like this:

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-injection-async-provider.ts

## Use Entity TypeORM with Controller

We need to define an Entity TypeORM like this and use Ts.ED Decorator to define the JSON Schema.

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-entity.ts

Now, the model is correctly defined and can be used with a [Controller](/docs/controllers.md), [AJV validation](/tutorials/ajv.md),
[Swagger](/tutorials/swagger.md) and [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).

We can use this model with a Controller like that:

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-entity-controller.ts

## EntityRepository

You can create a custom repository which should contain methods to work with your database.
Usually custom repositories are created for a single entity and contain their specific queries.
For example, let's say we want to have a method called `findByName(firstName: string, lastName: string)` which will search for users by a given first and last names.
The best place for this method is in Repository, so we could call it like `userRepository.findByName(...)`.
You can achieve this using custom repositories.

`@tsed/typeorm` plugin configures the DI so that repositories declared for TypeORM can be injected into a Ts.ED controller or service.

The first way to create a custom repository is to extend Repository. Example:

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-entity-repository.ts

Then inject your repository to another service:

<<< @/tutorials/snippets/typeorm/typeorm-injection-entity-repository.ts

::: tip
Use @@UseConnection@@ decorator to select which database connection the injected repository should be used (require Ts.ED v5.58.0+).
