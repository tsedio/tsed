# GraphQL

<Banner src="/graphql.svg" height="200" />

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL
provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly
what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## Feature

- Create [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server.html) Server and bind it with
  Ts.ED,
- Create multiple servers,
- Support [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/), [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/) or standalone Apollo server.

## Apollo

Unlock microservices potential with Apollo GraphQL. Seamlessly integrate APIs, manage data, and enhance performance. Explore Apollo's innovative solutions.
Ts.ED provides a module to create multiple Apollo server and bind it with Ts.ED server (Express or Koa).

See [here](/tutorials/graphql-apollo.md) for more details.

## Nexus

GraphQL Nexus' APIs were designed with type-safety in mind. We auto-generate type-definitions as you develop, and infer them in your code, giving you IDE completion and type error catching out of the box!

See [here](/tutorials/graphql-nexus.md) for more details.

## TypeGraphQL

Although TypeGraphQL is data-layer library agnostic, it integrates well with other decorator-based libraries, like TypeORM, sequelize-typescript or Typegoose.

See [here](/tutorials/graphql-typegraphql.md) for more details.

## GraphQL WS (subscription)

GraphQL Websocket allows you to use the `subscription` feature of GraphQL using the Websocket transport protocol.

See [here](/tutorials/graphql-ws.md) for more details.

## ApolloService

ApolloService let you retrieve an instance of ApolloServer:

```typescript
import {Injectable, AfterRoutesInit} from "@tsed/common";
import {graphQLService} from "@tsed/apollo";
import {ApolloServer} from "@apollo/server";

@Injectable()
export class UsersService implements AfterRoutesInit {
  @Injec()
  apolloService: ApolloService;

  private server: ApolloServer;

  $afterRoutesInit() {
    this.server = this.apolloService.get("server1");
  }
}
```

## DataSources

Apollo Server provides a mechanism to fetch data from a REST API or a database. This mechanism is called DataSources.
Ts.ED allow you to register your DataSources using the @@DataSource@@ decorator.

```typescript

```

## Testing

Here is an example to create a test server based on TypeGraphQL and run a query:

::: tip

The unit example is also available to test any Apollo Server!
