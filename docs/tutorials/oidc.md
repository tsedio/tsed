## Features

Ts.ED provides decorators and services to create an OIDC provider with your Ts.ED application.

- Create interactions policies,
- Create views,
- Use adapters to connect oidc-provider with redis/mongo/etc...
- Automatically create jwks keys on startup

## Installation

Before using the `@tsed/oidc-provider` package, we need to install the [oidc-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oidc-provider) module.

```bash
npm install --save oidc-provider
npm install --save @tsed/oidc-provider @tsed/jwks @tsed/adapters
```

Then we need to follow these steps:

- Configure the oidc server,
- Create the Accounts provider
- Create the Interactions controller,
- Create our first Login interaction and views,

::: tip
Select "OpenID Connect provider" upon initialization with the Ts.ED CLI and the following will be automatically generated.
:::

## Configuration

To use oidc-provider with Ts.ED it requires some other Ts.ED features to work properly. 

- Adapters to manage database connection,
- [Views](/docs/templating.md#configuration) to display pages.

Use `tsed init yourApp` to create a TSed application and adjust `Server.ts`:
```typescript
...
import {Configuration} from "@tsed/di";
import {Accounts} from "./services/Accounts"; 
import {InteractionsCtrl} from "./controllers/oidc/InteractionsCtrl"; 

export const rootDir = __dirname;

@Configuration({
  httpPort: 8083,
  mount: {
   "/": [InteractionsCtrl]
  },
  adapters: {
    lowdbDir: join(rootDir, "..", '.db'),
    Adapter: FileSyncAdapter
  },
  oidc: {
    // path: "/oidc",
    Accounts: Accounts,
    jwksPath: join(__dirname, "..", "..", "keys", "jwks.json"),
    clients: [
      {
        client_id: "client_id",
        client_secret: "client_secret",
        redirect_uris: [
          "http://localhost:3000"
        ],
        response_types: ["id_token"],
        grant_types: ["implicit"],
        token_endpoint_auth_method: "none"
      }
    ],
    claims: {
      openid: ["sub"],
      email: ["email", "email_verified"]
    },
    features: {
      // disable the packaged interactions
      devInteractions: {enabled: false},
      encryption: {enabled: true},
      introspection: {enabled: true},
      revocation: {enabled: true}
    }
  },
  views: {
    root: `${rootDir}/views`,
    extensions: {
      ejs: "ejs"
    }
  }
})
...
```

### Options

<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/src/domain/OidcSettings.ts

Documentation on other options properties can be found on the [oidc-provider](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/blob/master/docs/README.md) documentation page.

::: warning
It is advised to set `path` to `/oidc` to prevent oidc-provider becoming the default exception handler on all routes. In future versions of Ts.ED this will be the default value.
:::

## TLS proxy
The OpenID Connect specification does not allow unsecured HTTP requests and oidc-provider blocks them by default. While there is a [workaround](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/blob/main/recipes/implicit_http_localhost.md), the proper way is to use a TLS offloading proxy in front of your app.
When developing, the easiest way is to use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). To use it, set `proxy: true` in your [options](#Options) and then run:
```
caddy reverse-proxy --from localhost:8443 --to localhost:8083
```

## Accounts
oidc-provider requires an Account model to find an account during an interaction. The model can be used in conjunction with the adapter to fetch an account.

  <Tab label="services/Accounts.ts">

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

::: tip
Claims method is used by oidc-provider to expose this information in the userInfo endpoint.
:::

::: tip
We use the `$onInit` hook to create the first account automatically. You can adapt the script to your needs. 
:::
## Interactions

Interactions are the user flows in oidc-provider. For example, the login page is considered by oidc-provider as an interaction.
We can define many interactions during the authentication flow, for example:

- Login,
- E-mail verification,
- Password recovery,
- Sharing account data consent,
- etc.

To have a working OIDC server with Ts.ED, we need to create at least a login and a consent interaction.
To start, we have to create the `Interactions` controller which will be responsible to run all of our future
custom interactions.

In your controller's directory, create the `oidc/InteractionsCtrl.ts` file and copy the following code:

<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/controllers/oidc/InteractionsCtrl.ts

::: tip Note
The controller Interactions exposes the routes to display any interaction. Here we expose the route GET `/interation/:uid`

The `uid` is the unique session id used by oidc-provider to identify the current user flow.
:::

Now that we have our interactions controller, we can create our first interaction.

Create a new directory `interactions`. We will store all custom interactions in this directory.

<Tabs class="-code">
  <Tab label="LoginInteraction.ts">

<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/interactions/LoginInteraction.ts

  </Tab>
  <Tab label="ConsentInteraction.ts">

<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/interactions/ConsentInteraction.ts
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

::: tip 
`$prompt` is a special hook called by your Interactions controller.
:::


At this step, you can start the OIDC server and check the logs server to see if the well-known configuration 
has been correctly exposed:

```sh
[2021-01-04T07:35:31.523] [INFO ] [TSED] - WellKnown is available on http://0.0.0.0:8083/.well-known/openid-configuration
```
Try also to open the link in your browser!

Now, we need to add the Views to display our login page. Create a views directory on root level and create the following files:

<Tabs class="-code">
  <Tab label="login.ejs">

<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/views/login.ejs

  </Tab>
  <Tab label="forms/login-form.ejs">

<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/views/forms/login-form.ejs
    
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="partials/header.ejs">
   
<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/views/partials/header.ejs      
      
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="partials/footer.ejs">

<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/views/partials/footer.ejs   
    
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="partials/login-help.ejs">
  
<<< @/../packages/security/oidc-provider/test/app/views/partials/login-help.ejs   
  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The login page is ready to be displayed. To test it, open the following link:

```
http://localhost:8083/auth?client_id=client_id&response_type=id_token&scope=openid&nonce=foobar&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000

```

## Alter OIDC policy

Ts.ED emits a special `$alterOidcPolicy` event when @tsed/oidc-provider links interactions with OIDC policy. You can change the policy configuration
by adding `$alterOidcPolicy` on InteractionsCtrl:

```typescript
import {Get} from "@tsed/common";
import {Interactions, OidcCtx, DefaultPolicy} from "@tsed/oidc-provider";
import {LoginInteraction} from "../../interactions/LoginInteraction";

@Interactions({
  path: "/interaction/:uid",
  children: [
    LoginInteraction // register its children interations 
  ]
})
export class InteractionsCtrl {
  @Get("/")
  async promptInteraction(@OidcCtx() oidcCtx: OidcCtx) {
    return oidcCtx.runInteraction();
  }

  $alterOidcPolicy(policy: DefaultPolicy) {
    // do something
   
    return policy
  }
}
```
