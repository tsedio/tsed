# Providers

Basically, almost everything may be considered as a provider â€“ service, factory, interceptors, and so on. All of them
can inject dependencies, meaning, they can create various relationships with each other. But in fact, a provider is
nothing else than just a simple class annotated with an `@Injectable()` decorator.

In controllers chapter, we've seen how to build a Controller, handle a request and create a response. Controllers shall
handle HTTP requests and delegate complex tasks to the **providers**.

The providers are plain javascript class and use one of these decorators on top of them. Here is the list:

<ApiList query="['Injectable', 'Module', 'Service', 'Controller', 'Interceptor', 'JsonMapper', 'Middleware', 'Protocol'].indexOf(symbolName) > -1" />

## Services

Let's start by creating a simple CalendarService provider.

<<< @/docs/snippets/providers/getting-started-service.ts

::: tip Note

@@Service@@ and @@Injectable@@ have the same effect. @@Injectable@@ accepts options, @@Service@@ does not.
A Service is always configured as `singleton`.

Example with @@Injectable@@:

<<< @/docs/snippets/providers/getting-started-injectable.ts

:::

Now we have the service class already done, let's use it inside the `CalendarsController`:

<<< @/docs/snippets/providers/getting-started-controller.ts

Finally, we can load the injector and use it:

<<< @/docs/snippets/providers/getting-started-serverloader.ts

::: tip NOTE

You'll notice that we only import the CalendarsController and not the CalendarsService as that would be the case
with other DIs (Angular / inversify). Ts.ED will discover automatically services/providers as soon as it is imported
into your application via an import ES6.

In most case, if a service is used by a controller or another service which is used by a controller, it's not necessary
to import it explicitly!
:::

## Dependency injection

Ts.ED is built around the **dependency injection** pattern. TypeScript emits type metadata on the constructor which will
be exploited by the @@InjectorService@@ to resolve dependencies automatically.

```typescript
import {Injectable} from "@tsed/di";

@Injectable()
class MyInjectable {
  constructor(private calendarsService: CalendarsService) {}
}
```

It's also possible to inject a service on a property by using @@Inject@@ decorator:

```typescript
import {Injectable, Inject} from "@tsed/di";

@Injectable()
class MyInjectable {
  @Inject()
  private calendarsService: CalendarService;

  $onInit() {
    console.log(this.calendarsService);
  }
}
```

In this case, the service won't be usable in the constructor. If you have to do something with the injected service,
you can use the `$onInit` hook.

## Scopes

All providers have a lifetime strictly dependent on the application lifecycle. Once the server is created, all providers
have to be instantiated. Similarly, when the application shuts down, all providers will be destroyed. However, there are
ways to make your provider lifetime **request-scoped** as well. You can read more about these
techniques [here](/docs/injection-scopes.md).

## Binding configuration

All configurations set with @@Module@@ or @@Configuration@@ can be retrieved with @@Constant@@ and @@Value@@ decorators.
These decorators can be used with:

- [Service](/docs/services.md),
- [Controller](/docs/controllers.md),
- [Middleware](/docs/middlewares.md),
- [Pipes](/docs/pipes.md).

@@Constant@@ and @@Value@@ accept an expression as parameter to inspect the configuration object and return the value.

<<< @/docs/snippets/providers/binding-configuration.ts

::: warning

@@Constant@@ returns an Object.freeze() value.
:::

::: tip NOTE

The values for the decorated properties aren't available on constructor. Use \$onInit() hook to use the
value.
:::

## Custom providers

The Ts.ED IoC resolves relationships providers for you, but sometimes, you want to tell to the DI how you want to
instantiate a specific service or inject different kind of providers based on values, on asynchronous or synchronous
factory or on external library. Look [here](/docs/custom-providers.md) to find more examples.

## Configurable provider

Sometimes you need to inject a provider with a specific configuration to another one.

This is possible with the combination of @@Opts@@ and @@UseOpts@@ decorators.

<<< @/docs/snippets/providers/configurable-provider.ts

::: warning

Using @@Opts@@ decorator on a constructor parameter changes the scope of the provider
to `ProviderScope.INSTANCE`.
:::

## Inject many provider

This feature simplifies dependency management when working with multiple implementations of the same interface using type code.

If users use the same token when registering providers, the IoC container should exchange a token for a list of instances. Let's consider the following real example:

```typescript
interface Bar {
  type: string;
}

const Bar: unique symbol = Symbol("Bar");

@Injectable({type: Bar})
class Foo implements Bar {
  private readonly type = "foo";
}

@Injectable({type: Bar})
class Baz implements Bar {
  private readonly type = "baz";
}
```

Now as a user, I would like to create a [registry](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/registry.html) and retrieve an appropriate instance by type:

```typescript
@Controller("/some")
export class SomeController {
  constructor(@Inject(Bar) private readonly bars: Bar[]) {}

  @Post()
  async create(@Body("type") type: "baz" | "foo") {
    const bar: Bar | undefined = this.bars.find((x) => x.type === type);
  }
}
```

or in the following way as well:

```typescript
@Controller("/some")
export class SomeController {
  constructor(private readonly injector: InjectorService) {}

  @Post()
  async create(@Body("type") type: "baz" | "foo") {
    const bars: Bar[] = this.injector.getAll<Bar>(Bar);
    const bar: Bar | undefined = bars.find((x) => x.type === type);

    // your code
  }
}
```

## Override an injection token

By default, the `@Injectable()` decorator registers a class provider using an injection token obtained from the metadata generated by TypeScript.
That means that you have to use a concrete class as a token to resolve a provider.

To override an injection token, that is needed to resolve an instance, use the `@Injectable` decorator like this:

<<< @/docs/snippets/providers/override-injection-token.ts

An injection token may be either a string, a symbol, a class constructor.

## Import a provider from configuration <Badge text="7.74.0+" />

Sometimes you need to import a provider depending on the environment or depending on a runtime context.

This is possible using the DI configuration `imports` option that let you fine-tune the provider registration.

Here is an example of how to import a provider from a configuration:

```ts
import {Configuration} from "@tsed/di";

const TimeslotsRepository = Symbol.for("TimeslotsRepository");

interface TimeslotsRepository {
  findTimeslots(): Promise<any[]>;
}

class DevTimeslotsRepository implements TimeslotsRepository {
  findTimeslots(): Promise<any[]> {
    return ["hello dev"];
  }
}

class ProdTimeslotsRepository implements TimeslotsRepository {
  findTimeslots(): Promise<any[]> {
    return ["hello prod"];
  }
}

@Configuration({
  imports: [
    {
      token: "TimeslotsRepository",
      useClass: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? ProdTimeslotsRepository : DevTimeslotsRepository
    }
  ]
})
export class Server {}
```

## AutoInjectable <Badge text="7.82.0+" />

AutoInjectable decorator factory that replaces the decorated class' constructor with a parameterless constructor that has dependencies auto-resolved.

```ts
import {AutoInjectable, Inject} from "@tsed/di";

@AutoInjectable()
class Foo {
  constructor(
    private options: {collection: string},
    @Inject(Database) readonly database?: Database
  ) {
    console.log(this.options);
  }
}

// In other service
@Injectable()
class Bar {
  doSomething() {
    const foo = new Foo({collection: "test"});

    foo.database?.connect();
  }
}
```

::: tip
Notice how in order to allow the use of the empty constructor `new Foo()`, we need to make the parameters optional, e.g. `database?: Database`.
:::

::: warning
An AutoInjectable class cannot be created outside the DI context. You muse use the class inside an injectable class.
Also, AutoInjectable doesn't add the class to the container registry. So the class cannot be injected using `@Inject` or through the constructor arguments.
:::

## Lazy load provider

By default, modules are eagerly loaded, which means that as soon as the application loads, so do all the modules,
whether or not they are immediately necessary. While this is fine for most applications,
it may become a bottleneck for apps running in the **serverless environment**, where the startup latency `("cold start")` is crucial.

Lazy loading can help decrease bootstrap time by loading only modules required by the specific serverless function invocation.
In addition, you could also load other modules asynchronously once the serverless function is "warm" to speed-up the bootstrap time for subsequent calls even further (deferred modules registration).

You can read more about these techniques [here](/docs/providers-lazy-loading.md).

## Override provider

Any provider (Provider, Service, Controller, Middleware, etc...) already registered by Ts.ED or third-party can be
overridden by your own class.
