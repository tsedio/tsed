# Create your first controller

Create a new `CalendarCtrl.ts` in your controllers directory (by default `root/controllers`).
All controllers declared with @@Controller@@ decorators are considered as Platform routers (Express.Router, Koa.Router, ...).
A Platform router requires a path (here, the path is `/calendars`) to expose an url on your server.
More precisely, it's a part of a path, and the entire exposed url depends on the Server configuration (see [Configuration](/docs/configuration.md))
and the [children controllers](/docs/controllers.md).

In this case, we have no dependencies and the root endpoint is set to `/rest`.
So the controller's url will be `http://host/rest/calendars`.

::: tip
Decorators @@Get@@, @@Post@@, @@Delete@@, @@Put@@, etc., support dynamic pathParams (eg: `/:id`) and `RegExp` like Express API.

See [Controllers](/docs/controllers.md) section for more details
:::

::: warning
You have to configure [engine rendering](/tutorials/templating) if you want to use the decorator @@Render@@.
:::

To test your method, just run your `server.ts` and send an HTTP request on `/rest/calendars/1`.
