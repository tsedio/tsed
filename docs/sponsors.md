# Support us

## About Ts.ED

Ts.ED is an MIT-licensed <strong>Open-Source</strong> project which grows continuously thanks to community's support.
This framework is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working after hours, and busy weekends.

## How can you help?

Ts.ED doesn't have a company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the development.

I fully rely on the **goodness** <BxIcon name="bx bxs-heart" /> of the community.
However, I would love to create a team around this framework to improve and maintain it.

In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:

- become a backer or sponsor on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/tsed)
- use [PayPal](https://paypal.me/romainlenzotti) to send a one-time donation

<SupportOptions />

If you fell in love with Ts.ED, or you run a business which is using Ts.ED, consider sponsoring its development
to ensure that the project which your product relies on is actively maintained and improved.
Also, your support could help me and the future teams to work more on content that benefits whole Ts.ED community.
