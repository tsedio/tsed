# ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm using Ts.ED

If you (or your company) are using the framework Ts.ED - please let us know. We'd love to hear from you!

Ts.ED is a community driven project, which means it's not maintained by a company. If you would like to help us - any of the following is greatly appreciated.

We would love to add a company section with your logos and an explanation of your usecases and give feedbacks.

- [ ] Give the repository a star ‚≠êÔ∏è
- [ ] Help out with issues
- [ ] Review pull requests
- [ ] Blog about this framework
- [ ] Make tutorials
- [ ] Give talks
- [ ] Support us

Thank you! üíê
