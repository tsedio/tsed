/**
 * Use a view and sends the rendered HTML string to the client. Optional parameter:
 *
 * * viewOptions, an object whose properties define local variables for the view.
 *
 * The view argument is a string that is the file path of the view file to render.
 * This can be an absolute path, or a path relative to the views setting.
 * If the path does not contain a file extension, then the view engine setting determines the file extension.
 * If the path does contain a file extension, then Express will load the module for the specified template engine (via require())
 * and render it using the loaded moduleâ€™s __express function.
 *
 * For more information, see [Using template engines with Express](http://expressjs.com/guide/using-template-engines.html).
 *
 * > NOTE: The view argument performs file system operations like reading a file from disk and evaluating Node.js modules,
 * and as so for security reasons should not contain input from the end-user.
 *
 * @param path Relative path to the view file.
 * @param options Additional options
 * @decorator
 * @operation
 * @response
 * @ignores
 * @deprecated Use View decorator from @tsed/platform-views instead.
