A package of Ts.ED framework. See website: https://tsed.io

## Feature

EventEmitter module (`@tsed/event-emitter`) allows you to subscribe and listen
for various events that occur in your application based on methods decorated by
`@OnEvent` and `@OnAny`. Events can be emitted via the `EventEmitterService`.

Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your application,
since a single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each
other. For example, you may wish to send a Slack notification to your user each
time an order has shipped. Instead of coupling your order processing code to
your Slack notification code, you can raise an OrderShipped event, which a
listener can receive and transform into a Slack notification.

The module internally uses the eventemitter2 package. For more information look at the documentation [here](https://github.com/EventEmitter2/EventEmitter2);

## Installation

To begin, install the EventEmitter module for Ts.ED:

```bash
npm install --save @tsed/event-emitter
npm install --save eventemitter2
```

## Configure your server

Import `@tsed/event-emitter` in your Server:

```typescript
import {Configuration} from "@tsed/common";
import "@tsed/event-emitter"; // import event emitter ts.ed module

@Configuration({
  eventEmitter: {
    enabled: true, // Enable events for this instance.
    // pass any options that you would normally pass to new EventEmitter2(), e.g.
    wildcard: true
  }
})
export class Server {}
```

## Setup event listener

Decorate any method within a Provider (like `@Injectable`, `@Service`,
`@Controller`) with the `@OnEvent` or `@OnAny` decorator. Make sure the class
is imported somewhere or the Provider will not be registered.

```typescript
import {Injectable} from "@tsed/common";
import {OnEvent} from "@tsed/event-emitter";

interface OrderShippedEvent {
  orderId: string;
}

@Injectable()
export class SlackNotificationService {
  @OnEvent("order.shipped", {
    /* optional: add any option you would normally pass to emitter.on("order.shipped", options) */
  })
  sendOrderNotification(event: OrderShippedEvent) {
    // implement something here
  }
}
```

## Inject EventEmitter

Inject the EventEmitterService instance to interact with it directly, e.g. to emit an event.

```typescript
import {Service, Inject} from "@tsed/common";
import {EventEmitterService} from "@tsed/event-emitter";

@Service()
export class OrderService {
  @Inject()
  private eventEmitter: EventEmitterService;

  shipIt(orderId: string) {
    // do something ...
    // then send an event
    this.eventEmitter.emit("order.shipped", {orderId});
  }
}
```
