/**
 * Container for request-scoped and instance-scoped provider instances.
 *
 * Stores instances created within a specific execution context (like an HTTP request).

 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {LocalsContainer} from "@tsed/di";
 *
 * const locals = new LocalsContainer();
 * locals.set(MyService, serviceInstance);
 *
 * const instance = locals.get(MyService);
 *
 * await locals.destroy(); // Cleanup when context ends
 * ```
 *
 * @public
